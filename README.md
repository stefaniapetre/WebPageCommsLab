# WebPageCommsLab - Project 'Future Digital CV'
 This project involves creating a personal website showcasing skills learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The choice of a blue and white colour scheme to go with the media, especially the personal photo, was made with the intention of making a polished impression on prospective employers. The work was also intended to be displayed for future reference.

I procrastinated at first, but I eventually saw that productive work was necessary. At first, I was inspired by examples from W3 School and changed the code to fit my needs. Changing the background colour to match the blue and white design was the biggest obstacle, but it was doable.

Linking the folder to the upload code for images presented another challenge. One picture loaded incorrectly at first, but I was able to fix the problem in the end.

Another problem I had, and am thankful to Professor Mansor for helping me with, was separating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript portions.

Considering that this was my first webpage, I'm happy with the result. In the future, I want to work with additional interactive media and try out other colour schemes.
